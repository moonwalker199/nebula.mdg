A contract is a legally binding agreement between two or more parties. Essential elements of a contract include offer, acceptance, consideration, and mutual intent to be bound.

The Constitution is the supreme law of the land and serves as the foundation for all legal frameworks. It outlines the separation of powers, fundamental rights, and the responsibilities of each branch of government.

Tort law deals with civil wrongs and damages caused by negligence, defamation, or intentional misconduct. Criminal law, on the other hand, pertains to offenses against the state and includes penalties like fines or imprisonment.

Legal procedures often include filing a complaint, serving a notice, conducting discovery, and presenting evidence in court.
